# Minimalistic-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-Panel
This Premiere extension is a minimum in order to run a Panel in Premiere.

Download the code and put the folder in one of these places:  
Win: `C:\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\CEP\extensions`  
Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions`  

Since Premiere only accepts signed extension, you should tell it to accept unsigned extensions like this as well:

Launch Premiere Pro and open this Panel under Window > Extensions > Testing
